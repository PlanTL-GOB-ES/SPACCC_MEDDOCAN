# MEDDOCAN: Evaluation Script (CODALAB version)

## Digital Object Identifier (DOI)


## Introduction

This script is the COBALAB version of the original evaluation script. It
has been adapted to fit the requirements of the platform, but otherwise, 
it works exactly like the original script.

It is distributed as apart of the Medical Document Anonymization
(MEDDOCAN) task. It is based on the evaluation script from the i2b2 2014
Cardiac Risk and Personal Health-care Information (PHI) tasks. It is
intended to be used via command line:

<pre>
$> python evaluate.py input_folder/ output_folder/
</pre>

It produces Precision, Recall and F1 (P/R/F1) and leak score measures for
the NER subtrack and P/R/F1 for the SPAN subtrack. The latter includes an
additional metric where the spans are merged if only non-alphanumerical
characters are found between them.

## Prerequisites

This software requires to have Python 3 installed on your system.


## Directory structure

<pre>
annotated_corpora/
This directory contains files with annotations Brat annotation format. It may contain
different sub-directories for different annotation levels: tokens, sentence splitting,
part-of-speech taggin, etc. The sub-directory `sentence_splitting` is mandatory to 
compute the `leak score` evaluation metric. These files must be stored with `.ann` 
suffix.

input/
This directory contains the gold standard files and the systems submission files (in this
distribution we include the development set). Gold standard files must be placed under 
the `ref` directory and system files under the `res` directory. The `ref` directory 
contains two subdirectories with the files in `brat` and `xml` formats. The `res` 
directory can contain two subdirectories with the files in `brat` and`xml` formats, and 
at least one of them is required. In both format are included, the `brat` format is used 
by the script. Files in the previous directories must be in the appropriate format: `.ann` 
and `.txt` for `brat`, and `.xml` for `xml`. 


output/
This directory where the script outputs the results for the run.

## Usage
